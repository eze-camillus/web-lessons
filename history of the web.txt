The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist at CERN, in 1989. It was initially designed to help researchers share information. By 1991, the first website was launched, and the web became publicly accessible.

2. The Early Web (1991–1995)
This era saw the creation of basic, text-heavy websites. Browsers like Mosaic (1993) and Netscape Navigator (1994) made the web more accessible to everyday users. Websites were mostly static HTML pages.

3. Dot-com Boom (1995–2000)
Commercial interest exploded. Companies like Amazon (1994) and Google (1998) were founded. JavaScript (1995) enabled interactive websites. The number of websites skyrocketed, leading to the dot-com bubble.

4. Web 2.0 (2000–2010)
The web became more interactive and user-driven. Social media platforms like Facebook (2004) and YouTube (2005) emerged. AJAX technology allowed pages to update without reloading. Blogs, wikis, and content sharing became central.

5. Mobile and Cloud Era (2010–2020)
Smartphones and tablets transformed how people used the web. Responsive web design and mobile apps became standard. Cloud services and real-time collaboration (e.g., Google Docs) gained popularity.

6. Web Today (2020–Present)
The modern web is shaped by AI, immersive experiences (VR/AR), and privacy concerns. Web3 (blockchain-based web), progressive web apps (PWAs), and advanced JavaScript frameworks (like React and Vue) are influencing how websites are built and experienced.
